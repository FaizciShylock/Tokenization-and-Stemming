International climate change groups and influential advisers on the global shift from fossil fuels have written to the OECD expressing “grave concerns” over Australian politician Mathias Cormann’s bid to be its next secretary-general. Former Australian finance minister Cormann’s record in a government that “persistently failed to take effective action” to cut emissions while blocking international action meant he was “not a suitable candidate”, the letter says. Cormann is one of only two remaining candidates for the top OECD role after two candidates – Swiss banker Philipp Hildebrand and Greek politician Anna Diamantopoulou – withdrew earlier this week.
